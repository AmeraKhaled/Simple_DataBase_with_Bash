# Database Management System (DBMS) CLI App 

# Project Overview
  This project aims to develop a simple Database Management System (DBMS) that allows users to store and retrieve data from the hard disk using a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

# Features
The application provides a menu-driven interface with the following functionalities:
   Main Menu:
    - Create Database – Create a new database.
    - List Databases – View all available databases.
    - Connect to Database – Select a database to work with.
    - Drop Database – Delete a database permanently.
   Database Menu (After Connecting to a Database):
    - Create Table – Define a new table structure.
    - List Tables – Display all tables in the connected database.
    - Drop Table – Remove a table from the database.
    - Insert into Table – Add new records to a table.
    - Select from Table – Retrieve and display records from a table.
    - Delete from Table – Remove specific records from a table.
    - Update Table – Modify existing records in a table.
# How to Use
  Run the application in a terminal.
  Use the interactive menu to perform database operations.
  Data is stored and managed on the hard disk for persistence.
  ⚠️ Note: If you see a warning message in the background while running the application, it does not impact functionality and can be safely ignored.
# Future Enhancements (Optional)
  Add support for advanced SQL-like queries.
  Implement user authentication for database access.
  Improve performance using indexing techniques.
